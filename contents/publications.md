      <h3>Enhance Multi-View Classification through Multi-Scale Alignment and Expanded Boundary</h3>

        We propose MAMC to address the problems caused by the feature heterogeneity and the information redundancy. Through introducing the multi-scale alignment module, MAMC sufficiently mines the inter-view commonality to tighten instances and inter-class difference to delimit the decision boundaries.
        We propose a novel self-adaptive expanded boundary to tackle the ambiguous decision boundaries. By integrating the expanded boundary into the prototype-scale alignment module, the inter-class difference is reinforced to clear the ambiguous decision boundaries, while the representations inside the boundary are tightened.
        We explain the rationality of the model design theoretically, and extensive experimental results across diverse public datasets and comprehensive experimental analysis have verified that the proposed model shows significant superiority against the existing stateof-the-art models.
